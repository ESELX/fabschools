          <p class="boxed">
            We are looking for <strong>sustainable and engaging </strong>products and/or lessons <strong>open</strong> for collaboration and use and adaptable to the <strong>local and domestic contexts</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="boxed">For that, We are inviting designers, makers, and educators to present projects at any phase of its development: From tested solutions to well-presented concepts. <br>
            The challenge is to bring the virtues and <strong><a href="https://distributeddesign.eu/about/" target="_blank">values of Distributed Design</a></strong> into helping educators and other educational agents to adapt to these new contexts and scenarios in a usable and engaging way.
            The proposal should also address the model of fabrication and distribution.</p>
          <p class="boxed"> We are looking for <strong>educational products or activities based on physical materials</strong>. The design proposals must be self-explanatory and integrate answers to the questions raised above.
            This challenge targets K12 and is divided into <strong>two main categories</strong>:</p>
          <p class="boxed">
            <strong>A Lesson </strong>centered on learning through making. The output of the class should be a tangible object which should also be able to mobilize more than one school subject;<br>
            <strong>An educational product</strong>. Tangible, easy to fabricate. It can come out of a Fablab or in the format of kit for home assemblage. The product should promote learning through interaction in a challenging way.</p>

        <div class="one-half column">
          <p class="boxed">The School is trying to look beyond its walls in many ways. Stepping outside that frontier is a matter of study and experiences by many.
            Some authors recommend an ecosystemic approach by advocating distributed learning amongst diverse contexts, places, resources and products. To place the School in that ecosystem is an essential and complex reflection.
            <br><strong>How can we design the School beyond its walls?</strong></p>

          <p class="boxed">The promoters of this call have been working and researching about these for quite a while!
            The urgency of the moment, motivated by the COVID-19 crisis, brought all together. <br>
            The goal is to engage the Maker community, through its members, spaces and collectives of designers, artists, engineers and educators.
            Most are already deeply committed to the fight against COVID. Some are already focusing on the specifics of Maker education.<br>
            This call embeds the collective will of mapping and incentivizing the creation of new projects and educational practices that look at the domestic environment as an alternative (or extension) to formal education. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="one-half column">
          <p class="boxed">The call is an invitation for designers and other creatives to think about and present new products and educational resources for families at home.
            The proposals should be very clear about the way families or caregivers are integrated into the learning process.
            The way the users/makers access and use materials and the origin and sustainability of the material and technological options in these terms is also highly valued.
          </p>
          <p class="boxed">
          Therefore, we incentivize you to follow the Distributed Design values: <br>
            <strong>. Open Source;</strong><br>
            <strong>. Sustainable production and consumption;</strong><br>
            <strong>. Ecosystemic by connecting online and offline and consequently creation and “making”.</strong>

          <p>Tiago Almeida is an Adjunct Professor at the Higher School of Education of Polytechnic Institute of Lisbon and Integrated Researcher in CIE (Educational Research Center) at ISPA - University Institute. At the Higher School of Education, he coordinates the Post-Graduation in Toodler Education and the Department of Educational Psychology. Tiago is also FabLab Benfica Pedagogical Coordinator and Invited Coordinator in Higher School of Dance in Lisbon since 2014.  As a Professor of higher education, he works mostly on pre-school education master degrees. Within his functions, he is continually trying to absorb a set of questions resulting from research. As research interests, he is currently studying how children play. He is particularly interested in understanding how this activity allows children to learn about themselves and the world. To do so, he seeks to understand how adults, materials and resources can support this action without limiting it. Alongside his research about children play, he is interested in how can educational settings support children "becoming" within an ethical and relational agency in a collective world (i.e. interacting with human and non-human contexts, environments and materials).
